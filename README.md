Model 1: MOVIE RATING PREDICTION
Objective: Predict future sales based on historical data.
Dataset: Includes sales data with features such as date, store location, and product category.
Approach: Time-series analysis using ARIMA.
Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Results: Achieved a MAE of X on the test data.

Model 2: Customer Churn Prediction
Objective: Predict customer churn based on demographic and usage data.
Dataset: Customer records including features such as age, tenure, product usage.
Approach: Classification model using Random Forest.
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
Results: Model achieved an accuracy of Y on the validation dataset.
